* INT (SCALAR): integer scalar
* REAL (SCALAR): real scalar
* CPLX (SCALAR): complex scalar

* VECTOR: vector of undetermined type
* BOOL VECTOR: vector of boolean value
* INT VECTOR: integer vector
* REAL VECTOR: real vector
* CPLX VECTOR: complex vector

* MATRIX: matrix of undetermined type
* BOOL MATRIX: matrix of boolean value
* INT MATRIX: integer matrix
* REAL MATRIX: real matrix
* CPLX MATRIX: complex matrix

* ARRAY: n dimensional array of undetermined type
* BOOL ARRAY: n dimensional array of boolean value
* INT ARRAY: n dimensional integer array
* REAL ARRAY: n dimensional real array
* CPLX ARRAY: n dimensional complex array

* STRING: simple string

* STRUCT: structured data
* CELL: cell array

For these two last types, some precision have to be added about the type of their content.
