A S2KIT INTERFACE FOR MATLAB AND YAWTB:
================================================

This directory contains an interface between the (GPL) SOFT (SO(3)
Fourier Transforms) toolkit, based on the work of Driscoll, Healy,
Rockmore and Kostelec [1,2], and the YAWtb toolbox.

Interesting programs are:

* SOFTCORR (mex file): Fast Spherical (harmonic) Correlation between two spherical functions

WARNINGS:
=========

The equi-angular spherical grid where the spherical data are implicitely defined is
	(theta_i, phi_j) i=0..2B-1, j=0..2B-1
where theta_i = (2*i+1)*pi/(2*B)
      phi_j = j*2*pi/(2*B)
      B is the (maximal) bandwidth of the data. 

As for the line, the bandwidth B represents the maximum frequency 
that we can reach in our frequency description of data.

Remark that the North and South poles are excluded of this grid.
