A SPHARMONIC KIT INTERFACE FOR MATLAB AND YAWTB:
================================================

This directory contains an interface between the (GPL) SpharmonicKit [1]
based on the work of Driscoll, Healy and Rockmore [2], and the YAWtb
toolbox.

Interesting programs are:

* FST (mex file): Fast Spherical (harmonic) Transform for bandwidth > 64
* IFST (mex file): Fast Inverse Spherical Transform for bw > 64
* CONVSPH (mexfile): Fast Spherical Convolution for bw > 64
* CONVSPH_SEMI (mexfile): Fast Spherical Convolution for bw < 64
* FZT (mex file): Fast Zonal (spherical harmonic) Transform for bw > 64
* LMSHAPE (mfile): turns the output of FST in a more readable format
* ILMSHAPE (mfile): do the converse for further use of IFST
*                   which needs the original format

(* readmath (mex file): read mathematica list (ascii) formatted file of data.) 
(* writemath (mex file): write mathematica list (ascii) formatted file of data.) 

WARNINGS:
=========

The equi-angular spherical grid where the spherical data are implicitely defined is
	(theta_i, phi_j) i=0..2B-1, j=0..2B-1
where theta_i = (2*i+1)*pi/(2*B)
      phi_j = j*2*pi/(2*B)
      B is the (maximal) bandwidth of the data. 

As for the line, the bandwidth B represents the maximum frequency 
that we can reach in our frequency description of data.

Remark that the North and South poles are excluded of this grid.
