INSTALLING AND COMPILING THE SPHARMONICKIT INTERFACE FOR MATLAB AND YAWTB
=========================================================================

1°) Download the SPHARMONICKIT v2.6 at 
	http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~geelong/sphere/
and in particular at the link
	http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~geelong/sphere/SpharmonicKit26.tar.gz

2°) Untargezed it somewhere, say in /tmp. This will create a directory
called /tmp/SpharmonicKit26 containing all the SpharmonicKit stuff.

3°) Go inside this last directory and compile it:
	$> cd /tmp/SpharmonicKit26
	$> make
where '$>' stands for the shell prompt.

4°) Return in the directory containing this INSTALL file 
(that you are currently reading ;), say
	<yawtb>/continuous/sphere/spharmonickit 
and modify the file 'Makefile' as follow:
  at the top, you find a variable called SKDIR (for SpharmonicKit Directory). 
  Set it correspondingly to you SpharmonicKit directory, 
  that is in our example
	  SKDIR = /tmp/SpharmonicKit26

5°) in <yawtb>/continuous/sphere/spharmonickit/, type just
	make
    This will compile all the mex file related to this SK interface.

6°) That's it. Now you can go into a matlab session and test the different 
demo by entering:
	>> yademo fst
	>> yademo ifst
	>> yademo ilmshape

where '>>' stands for the matlab prompt.

And... the 'Fast!' continuous spherical transform
	>> yademo fcwtsph

7°) Enjoy of it and feel free to report any bugs/comments/wishes to the Yawtb mailing list.
